I'm a full-time Graduate Student at San Francisco State University, California. I am also a part time Teaching Assistance for a 'Seurity and Data Privacy' class. My master's research is based on Data Visualization for Social Media. Besides I am doing iOS Mobile Development course at  CodePath. I am also an active community member of Rewriting the Code.


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning D3.js and Data preprocessing with Python.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating iOS Mobile Application.
- ðŸ˜€ I like to solve problems, code, read, and organize in my free time.
- âš¡ Fun fact: If there is a bug in my code, I can't have a sound sleep :P
